Kari's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------

Ingredients:

1 (28 oz.) can petite diced tomatoes
1 tsp salt (or to taste)
2 medium green bell peppers
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium yellow bell pepper
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
1 medium white or yellow onion
2 cloves garlic


Time: 35 minutes



Directions:
1. Add the vegetable oil and sausage links (unsliced) to a large pot.
2. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
3. While the sausage is cooking, thinly slice the bell peppers and onions, and mince the garlic.
5. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.
7. Stir to combine and continue to cook over medium heat.
10. Stir to combine, place a lid on top, and allow the pasta to cook in the pepper sauce for about 5 more minutes, or until it has absorbed most of the liquid in the pot.
11. Add about a half teaspoon of salt, taste, and add more if needed.
