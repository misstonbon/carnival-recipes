Kari's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------

Time: 35 minutes

Ingredients:
2 medium green bell peppers
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium yellow bell pepper
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
1 medium white or yellow onion
2 cloves garlic


Directions:
1. Add the vegetable oil and sausage links (unsliced) to a large pot.
2. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
3. While the sausage is cooking, thinly slice the bell peppers and onions, and mince the garlic.


5. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.


7. Stir to combine and continue to cook over medium heat.
